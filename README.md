SQL

## Project Overview
In this project, we use MySQL to analyze a Loan Management System dataset. The focus is on performing advanced SQL analysis to uncover trends, patterns, and insights related to loans, repayments, and penalties.

## Key Features
- Import and structure the dataset into tables for customers, loans, repayments, and penalties.
- Apply advanced SQL techniques including joins, subqueries, common table expressions (CTEs), window functions, and conditional aggregations.
- Analyze loans and repayments using SQL to calculate monthly interest, total principal by type, running totals, identify overdue loans, classify loans by risk level, and explore customer, loan, and city-level patterns.
- Demonstrate professional SQL skills applicable to finance and banking analytics roles.
